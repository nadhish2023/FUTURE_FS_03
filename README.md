## About The Project

This project is a fully responsive, highly animated, and immersive digital experience for a conceptual automotive brand. It was built from the ground up to demonstrate a modern, professional frontend workflow, focusing on performance, rich user interactions, and a strong, futuristic design aesthetic inspired by the high-performance automotive world.

The goal was not just to build a static page, but a multi-chapter narrative that takes the user on a journey - from a powerful first impression to exploring the brand's legacy, anatomy, and unique features.

## Key Features

*   **Immersive Hero Section:** A full-screen video background with an animated, tri-color gradient headline and a subtle startup sound effect to set the tone.
*   **Infinite Car Showcase:** A seamlessly looping, CSS-driven carousel of the car lineup. The animation pauses on hover, revealing a glowing tri-color border and the car's name.
*   **"Scroll Evolve" Legacy Timeline:** A cinematic timeline where the content and path evolve based on the user's scroll position, creating a narrative storytelling effect.
*   **Interactive Anatomy Explorer:** Users can hover over hotspots on the car to reveal details about its key engineering features.
*   **Performance-Optimized:** Attention was paid to performance by using optimized video assets, efficient animations (CSS for loops, Framer Motion for interactions), and modern Next.js features.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** Every component is designed to be fully functional and aesthetically pleasing across all devices, from mobile phones to high-resolution desktops.
*   **Persistent Visual Identity:** A fixed tri-color bar and a "digital cockpit" background grid create a cohesive and branded feel throughout the entire experience.
